# com.aylien.text

This plugin exracts structured information and insights from text. Based on [AYLIEN Text Analysis API](http://aylien.com/text-api), it performs Summarization and Hashtag Suggestion for any piece of text (more features to be added soon).

The plugin defines a global `aylien` object, which defines various operations that are used for data extraction.

Although the object is in the global scope, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log(device.cordova);
    }

Summarization is used to summarize long articles by extracting a small number of key sentences.

        alert("Sentences:" + result.sentences);
    });


# aylien.hashtags

Using our automatic hashtag suggestion system, you can get a list of highly-relevant hashtags that will help you get more exposure for your content on Social Media.

        alert("Hash:" + result.hashtags);
